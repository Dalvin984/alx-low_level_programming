# TASKS


On this particular project, I learnt everything I need to know to get started with C language.I Learnt about the following:
[Keywords and identifiers](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/58ThnAAxwJv5s_ceKMMPhw),
[integers](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/2sXkmDiD7BF7pNIOxMQWFA),
[Arithmetic Operators in C](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/S-b9MN2iELhSEwCI093Vzw),
[if...else statement](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/CU6mSX1qdZKOhDEgmToUGA),
[Relational operators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/O1N-qacaTC-BHXm3Dp3eUA),
[Logical operators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/TaX_y6ll4cRfxCrxG8ZuNQ),
[While loop in C](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mwx2_bj3gIFEgCqdwdTp4w),
[While loop](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/MW4Ob-6JLWt7Zn6vZ0EsBw),

The following are the tasks that I solved:
## 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
