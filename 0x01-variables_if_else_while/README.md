# TASKS


On this particular project, I learnt everything I need to know to get started with C language.I Learnt about the following:
[Keywords and identifiers](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/58ThnAAxwJv5s_ceKMMPhw),
[integers](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/2sXkmDiD7BF7pNIOxMQWFA),
[Arithmetic Operators in C](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/S-b9MN2iELhSEwCI093Vzw),
[if...else statement](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/CU6mSX1qdZKOhDEgmToUGA),
[Relational operators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/O1N-qacaTC-BHXm3Dp3eUA),
[Logical operators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/TaX_y6ll4cRfxCrxG8ZuNQ),
[While loop in C](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mwx2_bj3gIFEgCqdwdTp4w),
[While loop](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/MW4Ob-6JLWt7Zn6vZ0EsBw),

The following are the tasks that I solved:
##### [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Dalvin984/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and returns a value to confirm whether a number is positive or negative

##### [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Dalvin984/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

#####[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Dalvin984/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
Writes a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Only putchar function is used(every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
Putchar function is only used twice at maximum.

#####[3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Dalvin984/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)
Writes a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
